The Simulator is currently a work in progress and was initially developed during the Mechatronics MSc thesis "Demonstrating Autonomous Hooking System for Cranes: Development of Embedded Perception and Control System" at the University of Agder by Lars Ã˜sterholt and Sindre Olsen in 2025 using MATLAB R2024b together with Simulink, and Simscape Multibody.

Open the HMFCraneMbsModel.slx file to start the Simulator.
